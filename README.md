# Percolation
Princeton University Algorithms Part I: Coursera

The main purpose of this project is to learn the Weighted Quick Union - path compression algorithm to understand developing dynamic connectivity applications.


Find the shortest and fastest path on a n-by-n grid using the Weighted QuicK Union algorithm. Also sees if the grid is percolated or not.
